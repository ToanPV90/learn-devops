## DESCRIPTION

ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.

ssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user name).  The user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using one of several methods (see below).

The options are as follows:

- -i identity_file
  - Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/identity for protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa for protocol version 2.  Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file. It is possible to have multiple -i options (and multiple identities specified in configuration files).  If no certificates have been explicitly specified by the CertificateFile directive, ssh will also try to load certificate information from the filename obtained by appending -cert.pub to identity filenames.

- -o option
  - Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file.  This is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate command-line flag.  For full details of the options listed below, and their possible values, see ssh_config(5).
  - option
    - StrictHostKeyChecking:
      - (info from ‘man ssh_config’) If this flag is set to yes, ssh(1) will never automatically add host keys to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses to connect to hosts whose host key has changed. This provides maximum protection against trojan horse attacks, though it can be annoying when the /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts file is poorly maintained or when connections to new hosts are frequently made.  This option forces the user to manually add all new hosts. If this flag is set to no, ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user known hosts files. If this flag is set to ask (the default), new host keys will be added to the user known host files only after the user has confirmed that is what they really want to do, and ssh will refuse to connect to hosts whose host key has changed. The host keys of known hosts will be verified automatically in all cases.
        "StrictHostKeyChecking" is a setting at the ssh client side.
      - If set to "No" new host keys will be automatically added to the known_hosts file, and changed host keys will be silently replaced.
      - Setting it to "yes" is meant to give some protection against trojan horse attacks, but every new or changed host key must be added or replaced manually.
      - I'd recommend setting it to "ask". With this setting at least new host keys will be added automatically after user confirmation, and changed host keys will never be replaced, so security is maintained yet life becomes a bit easier in an environment where many new hosts need to be accessed.

- -o Port
  - For giving port
- -X
  - Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.

## EXAMPLES

<br>

### Basic Login commands

- SSH login command

```bash
$ssh app@10.111.123.23
.
```

- If you want to use a different key file then

```bash
$ ssh -i keyFileName app@10.111.123.23
.
```

- Using `-o` to set options

```bash
$ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no app@$newHostname
.
```

- `Port` - Specifies the port number to connect on the remote host.  The default is 22.

```bash
$ ssh -v -o Port=2222 oracle@127.0.0.1
.
```

<br>

### X11 forwarding

- To login into remote host with X11 forwarding enabled use the following command. For more details see xclock

```bash
localUser@DESKTOP:~$ ssh remoteUser@35.238.65.79 -X
```

<br>

### Setting up ssh login between local and remote vm

- Local

```bash
localUser@DESKTOP:~$ uname -a
Linux DESKTOP 4.4.0-18362-Microsoft #1-Microsoft Mon Mar 18 12:02:00 PST 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
localUser@DESKTOP~$ ssh-keygen
```

- Remote

```bash
remoteUser@test-instance:~$ uname -a
Linux test-instance 4.9.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.189-3 (2019-09-02) x86_64 GNU/Linux
remoteUser@test-instance:~$ ssh-keygen
```

- Copy the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub of localUser to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of remoteUser with permission 600

- Remote

```bash
remoteUser@test-instance:~/.ssh$ vi authorized_keys
remoteUser@test-instance:~/.ssh$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

- Try logging in to the remote machine using ssh from the local machine

- Local

```bash
localUser@DESKTOP:~$ ssh remoteUser@35.238.65.79
remoteUser@test-instance:~$
```

<br>

### Logging via bastion server

- To login using the bastion server

```bash
$ ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -i private_key_to_login.pem -W %h:%p ubuntu@bastion.host.link" -i private_key_to_login.pem ubuntu@172.126.146.224 -vvvvv
.
```

<br>

### Running commands on remote server

- To run a command on another machine (like node01) from local (say controlplane)

```bash
controlplane $ ssh node01 ifconfig ens3
Warning: Permanently added 'node01,172.17.0.25' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

### Port Forwarding

connections to localhost:8081 --------------->------------are--forwared-to-the-remote-host------------------------>---- PUBLIC-IP:8081

Let's say you want to access a service running on remote server at port 8081 on your localhost at port 8081

```bash
<br>

## Assuming you have SSH access to the machine
$ ssh -L 8081:localhost:8081 opc@PUBLIC-IP
.
```

- Port forwarding via a Jump Server    connections to localhost:8081 -----are-forwarded-to--->-- PUBLIC-IP --> are-forwarded-to->---remote-private-host----->-------- PRIVATE-IP:8081

  - `ssh`: This command starts the SSH client program that allows secure connection to the SSH server on a remote machine.

  - `-L 8081:localhost:8081`: This is a specification of local port forwarding. It means that connections to the local (client) host on port 8081 are to be forwarded to the remote side (the server you're connecting to) via `localhost` at port 8081.

  - `-J <jump_server_username>@<jump_server_public_ip>`: This specifies the jump host (also known as a bastion host or gateway server). This is the intermediary server that you first SSH into before SSHing into the final destination server. This is used when the final destination server cannot be accessed directly from your starting point, but can be accessed from the jump server.

  - `<dest_host_username>@<destination_host_private_ip>`: This is the final destination server that you're connecting to via SSH. The `dest_host_username` is the username on the destination host, and the `destination_host_private_ip` is the IP address of the destination host.

  - `-N`: This tells SSH that no command will be sent once the tunnel has been set up. This is useful for just forwarding ports (protocol level tunneling).

  - `-f`: This option instructs SSH to go to the background just before command execution, allowing the SSH process to be run in the background.

  - `-q`: This option is used to make the operation quiet. It suppresses all warning and diagnostic messages, making them invisible to the user.

  Essentially, the command is saying to establish an SSH connection to `<destination_host_private_ip>` via the jump server at `<jump_server_public_ip>`, and any connections made to `localhost` on port 8081 on your local machine should be forwarded through the SSH connection, and then from the destination server to `localhost` at port 8081. All of this is done in the background and in quiet mode (no output is displayed).

```bash
$ ssh -L 8081:localhost:8081 -J <jump_server_username>@<jump_server_public_ip> <dest_host_username>@<destination_host_private_ip> -N -f -q 
.
# If you have separate keys for both
$ ssh -i /Users/<username>/workspace/_ssh/id_rsa_dest -L 6443:localhost:6443 -o ProxyCommand="ssh -i /Users/<username>/workspace/_ssh/id_rsa_jump  -W %h:%p <jump_login_user>@<jump_public_ip>" <dest_login_user>@<dest_private_ip> -N -f -q          # -v
.
```

### Reverse ssh tunnel

localhost:8081  <--------------------------------------reverse-ssh-tunnel------------------------------------ public_ip:8080          ( forward any incoming traffic on port 8080 from the remote server (34.135.214.178) back to the local machine's port 8081)

- Let's say we are running nginx service on port 8081 locally. We want this nginx service to be accessible on remote host with public IP 34.135.214.178 on port 8080.

> Note: Only root can bind ports numbered under 1024.

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -d -p 8081:80 --name web nginx
a637bfd7fc075b751ad5245c034b27a6afbf3509d47e73383b1af4e50688800f
$ curl -s  localhost:8081 | grep title  
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>

# Now we want this nginx to be accessible via the public ip on port 8080
$ ssh -R 8080:localhost:8081 34.135.214.178 -v
.
username@public-instance-1:~$ $ curl -s ifconfig.me
34.135.214.178

# edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and set GatewayPorts to yes 
username@public-instance-1:~$ cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
GatewayPorts yes

# Restart sshd for changes to take effect
username@public-instance-1:~$ sudo systemctl reload sshd

<br>

## Accessing this IP from internet
$ curl -s 34.135.214.178:8080 | grep title
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
```

1. `-R 8080:localhost:8081`: This is an option for the SSH command that specifies a remote port forwarding. It tells SSH to forward any incoming traffic on port 8080 from the remote server (34.135.214.178) back to the local machine's port 8081. The syntax is `-R [remote_port]:[destination]:[local_port]`.

2. `34.135.214.178`: This is the IP address (or hostname) of the remote server to which you want to connect using SSH.

3. `-v`: This is an optional flag that stands for "verbose" mode. When this flag is used, the SSH client will produce more detailed output during the connection process, which can be helpful for debugging and understanding what's happening behind the scenes.

Overall, this command is setting up a reverse SSH tunnel from the remote server at IP address 34.135.214.178 to the local machine, forwarding any incoming traffic on port 8080 of the remote server back to port 8081 on the local machine. The `-v` flag provides verbose output to show what's happening during the connection process. This can be useful for troubleshooting and monitoring the connection.
